# SpaceShapes
Do you want to see shapes bouncing around? SpaceShapes is an app where you can add any shapes you want (circles, rectangles, etc.)  into the window and watch them bounce around!

To start the application, run src/spaceshapes/shapesApp/SpaceShape.java.
You can use the command line or run it directly on Eclipse.
